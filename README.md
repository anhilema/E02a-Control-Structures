This was a project for my C220 class where we took a look at different control structures and answered questions about each one.
It led us through the process of understanding certain fundamentals about python.

#It asks for and takes input
#I think it just stored the input but couldn't do anything with it.
#It makes color a variable input and then tells it to print it.
#It did what I expected
#It is different because it has an if statement in it.
#9-12 is an if statement that checks the input to see if it matches an answer, and changing the response based on that
#answer. 10 and 12 are indented because they are connected to the statements above them.
#It doesn't count red as an answer because the condidtion is with red capitalized. I think it's saying that it has to be capitalized.
#it is different bby including both "reds" in the if statement. It's trying to solve capitalization errors
#Anything else won't be counted as a valid answer.
#I expect it to make the input all lowercase in order to solve the problem with capitals.
#It still messes up due to spaces. It doesn't count it as an answer.
#It's different by including a .strip(), which should get rid of all of the spaces in the input.
#Yup, you can break it by putting the spaces between the letters as opposed to just the beginning and end.
#I expect this to have three possible outcomes. Line 12 is an elif statement which is like the inbetween of if and else
#It can get placed between the two for a third possible option.
#Line 9 is the start of a loop, it will keep going until that condition is met.
#It wouldn't repeat the question
#It's so broken, oh my gosh, it just keeps looping because it doesn't ask for new feedback and keeps inputing
#The same one.
#Line 13 is adding 1 to the value of count and changing count's number to that of what it is when 1 is added.
#Line 22 is showing how many tries the player got the color in by displaying count's value.
